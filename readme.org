* Info
A multi-region VOF solver with conjugate heat transfer and a gradient-based phase change model. Developed using OpenFOAM version 2212.
Adapted from the standard OpenFOAM interFoam and chtMultiRegionFoam solvers, with the "implicit gradient" phase change model implemented by the [[https://github.com/DLR-RY/TwoPhaseFlow][TwoPhaseFlow project]].

* Test cases
The repository contains the following test cases:
- Growth of an isolated spherical bubble in uniformly superheated liquid.
- Growth of a bubble on a wall under subcooled flow boiling conditions (MAITY, S. 2000. Effect of velocity and gravity on bubble dynamics. University of California, Los Angeles).
