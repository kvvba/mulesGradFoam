* Info
Multi-region interfoam modified with a gradient-based phase change model.

* Test cases
The repository contains the following test cases:
- Growth of an isolated spherical bubble in uniformly superheated liquid.
- Growth of a bubble on a wall under subcooled flow boiling conditions (MAITY, S. 2000. Effect of velocity and gravity on bubble dynamics. University of California, Los Angeles).

* Adapting from interMultiKFoam
Copy T file to TL and TV, rename objects within the files but the other contents remain the same.

Add into ~divSchemes~ inside ~fvSchemes~ the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  div(rhoPhiCpL,TL)       Gauss SuperBee 1.0 phi;
  div(rhoPhiCpV,TV)       Gauss SuperBee 1.0 phi;
#+END_SRC

Add into ~solvers~ in ~fvSolution~ the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  "TV|TL"
  {
  	solver          PBiCGStab;
  	preconditioner  DILU;
  	tolerance       1e-10;
  	relTol          0.0;
  	minIter 5;
  	maxIter 50;
  }
  "(TV|TL)Final"
  {
  	solver          PBiCGStab;
  	preconditioner  DILU;
  	tolerance       1e-08;
  	relTol          0.0;
  	maxIter 50;
  }
#+END_SRC
